      <p>Hi! My name is Noe, and I am a rising junior computer science major at UCI. I am from San Diego, and I enjoy playing soccer, playing video games, and watching Youtube in my free time.</p>

      <p>I went to Barcelona last summer to visit family, and while I was there, I was lucky enough to watch my favorite soccer team play. I took this picture before the game.</p>

      <p>During that same summer, I got to see Portugal and Holland for the first time, which was really cool! I took the picture to the left in Porto, and the picture from the right is from Utrecht.
