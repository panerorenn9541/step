      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Noe, and I am a rising junior computer science major at UCI. I am from San Diego, and I enjoy playing soccer, playing video games, and watching Youtube in my free time. My favorite soccer team is FC Barcelona 
        because my dad is from Barcelona and they are my hometown team. Some of my favorite video games are X-Men Legends, The Simpsons Hit and Run, and Ultimate Spider-man. 
        I also enjoy watching Youtube, and my favorite Youtubers are KSI, RunTheFUTMarket, and David Dobrik. 
        In addition to these hobbies, I really like listening to music. A few of my favorite artists are Juice WRLD, Post Malone, Aries, and Iann Dior.

      <h2>Barcelona</h2>
      <p>I went to Barcelona last summer to visit some of my family, and while we were there we did so many cool things! One day, I went on a run with my brother in the mountains behind a palace that was built for 1929 International Exhibition. 
        We ran for around thirty minutes, and afterwards, we all watched the fountain light show that takes place at night in front of the palace. Then after that, we went to get Ice Cream at a shopping mall called Arenas, 
        which was originally a bullfighting arena that got remodeled after bullfighting became illegal in Barcelona. On one of the last days we were in Spain, 
        I was lucky enough to watch my favorite soccer team play, and I took the picture to the left before the game.</p>

      <h2>Europe</h2>
      <p>During that same summer, I got to see England, Holland, and Portugal for the first time, which was really fun! I had heard about a restaurant called Nando's for a long time, but they do not have any locations in California. 
        When we landed in London, the first thing we did, even before putting away our luggage, was go to Nando's, and we enjoyed it so much that we went there almost everyday. 
        One day, when we were walking around the city, I realized that there was a cup final in Wembley Stadium, which was on the other side of London. 
        We did not have tickets, but we decided to take the train to get over there and see the atmosphere. The picture to the left is from outside Wembley stadium before the match. 
        In the middle, I have a picture I took when I was in Utrecht, and over there, nearly everybody rode bicycles. We discovered an incredible dessert in Utrecht called stroopwafel, which is a wafer cookie made from
        joining two thin layers of baked dough with a caramel filling. Finally, our last stop was Porto, which was my favorite city other than Barcelona. In order to avoid missing a cool soccer game in Porto, like we did in London, 
        I made sure to check if FC Porto had any games on their schedule that lined up with the days we were staying there. When I checked, I saw that they were going to play a champions league qualification match against 
        Krasnodar from Russia, which is an exciting game. This matchup consisted of two games, and Porto had already won the first one in Russia 1-0, meaing that they could either tie or win to advance. The game started off horribly, 
        and Porto was down 3-0, but they started to mount a comeback in the second half, and they eventually pulled it back to 3-2. At that point the crowd was going crazy, and in one of the last plays of the game, 
        Porto had a really good chance to score and complete the comeback, but the player missed, and they lost, meaning they failed to qualify. The picture above and to the right is from after that game where the fans were booing the players. 
        However, despite this, Porto was an incredible city, and one of my favorite places was the Riberia, where I took the picture below to the right.
