      <p>
        This is an Android application that I made in my Senior year of high
        school using Java. The app has a user interface that allows the user to
        search for stores and switch between satellite and map views. The app
        has a location tracking feature that, when enabled, will drop markers
        every five seconds, forming a trail. When requested, the location
        tracking feature will allow the user to search for stores that are in
        the direction of travel. This is useful for cases in which the user is
        driving to a specific destination and it is inconvnient for them to go
        back on themselves when there is a restaurant location on the way. This
        app was made using Google Maps.

        ><h3>Dynamic Memory Allocator</h3></a
      >
      <p>
        This is a dynamic memory allocator that I made in my Freshman year of
        college using C. The program simulates the management of heap speace.
        The allocator does not create splinters, and when applicable, the
        allocator allows for coalescing. A LIFO policy was applied to manage the
        doubly linked free list, and a next-fit policy was used to allocate
        memory.

      <a href="https://github.com/panerorenn9541/Shell"><h3>Shell</h3></a>
      <p>
        This is a shell that I created also in my Freshman year of college using
        C. The program simulates a working shell application. The shell supports
        directory changing, background and foreground processes, redirection,
        and piping.
