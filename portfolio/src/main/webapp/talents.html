      <h2>Singing the Alphabet Backwards</h2>
      <p>
        In either second or third grade, we learned how to sing the alphabet
        backwards as a class. At the end of the year, we had a performance in
        front of our parents where each of us had a letter in the alphabet, and
        we would have to stand up and say it at the right time. For some reason,
        I never forgot how to sing the alphabet backwards, and I got really fast
        at doing it. The world record for the fastest time singing the alphabet
        backwards is 1.81 seconds, but I can consistantly do it in under 2
        seconds. The fastest I ever did it was around 1.5 seconds, but I timed
        it myself using a stopwatch, so it is unclear how accurate that time is.

      <h2>Cutting Hair</h2>
      <p>
        I have only attempted it twice, but both times that I tried to cut a
        design into my brother's hair, it turned out pretty well. The reason he
        asked me to do it is because he was going to CIF for soccer, and at our
        high school, everyone on the team got their hair done really wild for
        the CIF tournament. Beucase of this, it did not really matter if I did a
        good job or not, but it ended up looking pretty cool, so he asked me to
        do it again next year.
